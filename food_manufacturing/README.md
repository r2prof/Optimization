## Food Manufacture 1
This model is an example of a blending problem. In blending optimization problems, multiple raw materials are combined 
in a way the meets the stated constraints for the lowest cost.

More information on this type of model can be found in example #1 of the fifth edition of Modeling Building in 
Mathematical Programming by H. P. Williams on pages 253-254 and 296-298.

This modeling example is at the intermediate level, where we assume that you know Python and are familiar with the 
Gurobi Python API. In addition, you should have some knowledge about building mathematical optimization models.

## Food Manufacture 2
This model extends the Food Manufacture I example above to include new constraints that change the problem from a 
fairly easy to solve linear programming model to an mixed integer model that is harder to solve.

More information on this type of model can be found in example #2 of the fifth edition of Modeling Building in 
Mathematical Programming by H. P. Williams on pages 255 and 299-300.

This modeling example is at the advanced level, where we assume that you know Python and the Gurobi Python API and 
that you have advanced knowledge of building mathematical optimization models. Typically, the objective function 
and/or constraints of these examples are complex or require advanced features of the Gurobi Python API.
